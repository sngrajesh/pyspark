Kafka Topics CLI 
-----------------

>>>>$ ./run-kafka_zookeeper_server.sh -s start
>>>>$ ./run-kafka_server.sh -s start
>>>>$ jps
Look for this two application are running:
Kafka
QuorumPeerMain

----------------

$kafka-topics.sh

1) Create a topic
So, the first thing you want to do is kafka-topics, and we need to reference zookeeper,
and the reason we need to reference zookeeper is that, to create a topic, we have to 
point to zookeeper.
On third CLI give following command
>>>>$kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create

>>>>$kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create  --partitions 3

>>>>$kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --create --partitions 3 --replication-factor 2

2) List the topics
>>>>$kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --list
3) Describe the topics
>>>>$kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper 127.0.0.1:2181 --topic first_topic --describe

Exercise
â€”---------
Create a new topic, having name as second_topic, having six partitions, and then 
the replication factor, which is going to be one.

List all the topics to confirm the creation of the above topic.

Console Producer 
----------------

>>>>$kafka-console-producer.sh

1) Produce messages
So we are going to launch our first kafka-console-producer.
>>>>$kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic

2)
>>>>$kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --producer-property acks=all

Kafka console consumer
----------------------
>>>>$kafka-console-consumer.sh
1) Consume/read the messages
Open a new terminal window (say console consumer window)
so let's give it a try.
>>>>$kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic

2) But how do we do to read all the messages in the topic?
But how do we do to read all the messages in the topic? 
Because sometimes we need to. 
So, we launch the exact same command. But this time, we will do from beginning.
And by doing from beginning, we are going to ask console consumer to go to the 
beginning of topic and tell what the other is.
^C(Ctrl + C) the console consumer terminal, and again give following command
>>>>$kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --from-beginning

Kafka consumers in group
------------------------

1) Creating console consumer belonging to the group
In third CLI (consumer1 cli) give following command
>>>>$kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application

>>>>$kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic
